# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repository

Start in your terminal by creating a folder (in your current working directory), change directory into that folder and clone the project:

```
mkdir project-folder
```

```
cd project-folder
```

```
git clone https://github.com/dlynnea/repository-finder.git
```

### 2. Installing dependencies

To get this project running on your local machine, run npm install and npm start.

```
cd repository-finder
```

```
npm install
```

Note: Creates a `package-lock.json` file in your project folder.

### 3. Run server

```
npm run start
```

### 4. Open your browser

Then open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see the app.


> Note: This approach to scaffolding an app was heavily inspired by [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/), a very popular way to get started with a ReactJS app in the JavaScript community.
